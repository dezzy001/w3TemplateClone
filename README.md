## What did you learn
- position absolute
    - position absolute will be relative to a parent which has position relative, else will just be relative to the body by default
- max/min width : [reference](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_max-width.asp)
    - used max-width for .content-section
- CSS attribute:
  - This was required to style the input 'placeholder' attribute
  - The attribute doesn't inherit parent properties
  - Need to use the following syntax to select element attributes
```
selector[attribute]{
    property-name: property;
}
```
